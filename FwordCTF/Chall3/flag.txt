Reverse-engineering is used for many purposes: as a learning tool; as a way to make new,F compatible products that are cheaper than what's currently on the market; for making software interoperate more effectively or to bridge data between F different operating systems or databases; and to uncover the undocumented features of commercial products. Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a F compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable formatso you can read the flag which is:FwordCTF{4r3_Y0u_4_r0b0t}.Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.Assembly/Machine Code The C Programming Language Disassemblers Decompilers.
